# IDFG_TrailCam_SDProcess

Shiny app for copying, renaming, and uploading photos from Idaho Fish and Game trail cameras

Idaho Fish and Game (IDFG) deploys hundreds of trail cameras each year for wildlife population estimates and monitoring. This app performs initial processing of photos on SD cards pulled from trail cameras prior to species identification. These initial steps include copying photos from the card to a hard drive, recording photo metadata, checking for and fixing common data errors, renaming and organizing photos using a standard folder/filename structure, and uploading photos to the cloud.
