# IDFG_TrailCam_SDProcess

Idaho Fish and Game (IDFG) deploys hundreds of trail cameras each year for wildlife population estimates and monitoring. This R Shiny app performs initial processing of photos on SD cards pulled from trail cameras prior to species identification. These initial steps include copying photos from the card to a hard drive, recording photo metadata, checking for and fixing common data errors, renaming and organizing photos using a standard folder/filename structure, and uploading photos to the cloud.
